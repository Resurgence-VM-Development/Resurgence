Resurgence aims to be an embedable VM backend with an easy to use API for projects like:
* Game engines
* Full blown interpreters
* Applications that want custom scripting

Note: Resurgence is just a backend. This allows us to focus on making it good. For making a full blown VM, we recommend [Crafting Interpters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) to get an idea on how to make one. 

Right now, Resurgence is in the alpha phase, so don't expect stability for now
